<h1>TraceForensics</h1>


<h3>ABSTRACT:</h3>

<h5>The increasing complexity of cybercrimes presents significant challenges for digital forensic investigators, particularly in recovering, preserving, and authenticating critical evidence. Criminals leverage advanced techniques such as steganography to embed illicit transaction details within digital images, making detection and analysis difficult. Traditional forensic tools can recover deleted files but lack the capability to ensure the integrity, security, and traceability of evidence throughout the investigative process. The presented research work, TraceForensics, addresses these challenges by integrating forensic analysis with blockchain technology, providing a secure, immutable, and transparent framework for handling digital evidence, including the detection and analysis of steganography used to conceal illicit information. Firstly, the system enables investigators to recover deleted files using forensic tools and extract hidden data through steganographic decoding techniques. Secondly, it securely stores all case-related information on a blockchain. By combining advanced forensic methodologies with blockchain, this approach ensures that evidence remains immutable, tamper-proof, traceable, and legally admissible, enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of digital forensic investigations. The presented results would encourage researchers to use this TraceForensics prototype to strengthen cybercrime investigations and improve legal proceedings, ensuring that evidence remains untampered and justice is upheld.</h5>
